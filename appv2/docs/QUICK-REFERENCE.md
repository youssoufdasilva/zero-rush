## The Game in 30 Seconds

**Cards**: `+3`, `-5`, `*2`, `÷4` (operator + number)

**Goal**: Arrange cards to find:
- 🔵 **Dusk**: Lowest positive whole number (including 0) — sky blue (dark) / deep blue (light)
- 🟡 **Dawn**: Highest positive whole number — amber/gold

**Rules**:
- First card's operator is ignored
- Evaluate left-to-right (no PEMDAS)
- Find BOTH to win

**Example**: `9, +1, ÷2, -5` → 9 → 10 → 5 → **0** ✅
